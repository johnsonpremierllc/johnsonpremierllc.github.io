	<p>Real estate agents provide a variety of services to help buyers and sellers navigate the home buying or selling process. These services can include the following:</p>

	<h3>Listing your home</h3>
	<p>
		A real estate agent will list your home on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), which is a database of homes for sale. 
		They will also market your home through online listings, open houses, and other marketing channels.

	<h3>Showing your home</h3>
	<p>
		When a potential buyer is interested in your home, the real estate agent will schedule a showing. 
		They will be present at the showing to answer any questions the buyer may have and to make sure the buyer is comfortable with the home.

	<h3>Closing the deal</h3>
	<p>
		Once an offer has been accepted, the real estate agent will help you with the closing process. 
		This includes providing you with information about closing costs, helping you to choose a title company, and ensuring that the closing goes smoothly.
	</p>

	<h3>Providing after-sale support</h3>
	<p>
		After the closing, the real estate agent can provide you with after-sale support.
		This may include helping you to find a mortgage, finding a mover, or making recommendations for home improvement services.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is important to note that the services provided by real estate agents vary depending on the agent and the agency. 
		Some agents may offer additional services, such as home staging or home warranty. 
		It is always a good idea to interview several agents before choosing one to represent you.
